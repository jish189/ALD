We found these to be extremely sensitive to both the carrier density and the height of the confining barriers, which allows us to control the so-called ‘Spin Dependent Hole Delocalization’. The theoretical results are shown to be in excellent agreement with experiments.",1997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

These codon 200lys families have a total of 87 patients, and originate from 7 different countries: Slovakia, Poland, Germany, Tunisia, Greece, Libya, and Chile. Forty-seven patients were neuropathologically verified, and brain tissue from 14 patients transmitted disease to experimental primates.The mutation was found by direct sequencing in 4 patients, and it was detected by restriction endonuclease analysis with BsmA 1 and/or the single nucleotide extension reaction in 36 other patients and 45 of 109 first degree relatives (1 parent, 14 siblings, and 30 children).The mutation is associated with all known geographical clusters of CJD (Slovakia, Libyan Jews, Chile) in which the annual mortality rate is tens or hundreds of times higher than the world average of 1 per million. All patients originating from the cluster areas carried the mutation, but it was seen in only 1 of 103 unrelated control individuals from the same areas, and in none of 102 controls from other areas, indicating a strong association between the mutation and disease. The penetrance of the mutation was estimated to be 0.56.Branches of some families migrating from cluster areas to other countries continue to have CJD over several generations, suggesting that CJD in these families is a genetic disorder, in which the 200Lys mutation is responsible for the disease.",1991,29,69,2,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Both have the same molecular mass (74 kDa) on SDS/PAGE and appear to be equally active with three different fatty acid substrates. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of both forms were identical to the sequence of human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase [Sigal, E., Craik, C.S., Highland, E., Grunberger, D., Costello, L.L., Dixon, R.A.F. & Nadel, J.A.

By analysing the disturbance in spherical harmonics, the mathematical problem is reduced to one in characteristic values in a fourth-order differential equation and a variational principle characterizing the solution is enunciated. The particular case of a sphere of radius R and density p 1 embedded in a medium of a different density p 2 (but of the same kinematic viscosity v) is considered in some detail; and it is shown that the character of the equilibrium depends on the sign of γR(p 2 -p 1 ) and the magnitude of = γ R R 4 /v 2 . If γ R (p 2 -p 1 ) > 0, the situation is unstable and the mode of maximum instability is l = 1 for all R (p 2 -p 1 ) > 0 the results of both an exact calculation and an approximate calculation (based on the variational principle) are given and contrasted. In the case γ R (p 2 -p 1 ) < 0 when the situation is stable, the manner of decay of the disturbance is briefly discussed in terms of an approximate theory only.",1955,0,19,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5db4c6327ec3f7976f327dad780d3c723648006c,Structure and function in rhodopsin: peptide sequences in the cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin are intimately involved in interaction with rhodopsin kinase.,"Phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin by the retina-specific enzyme, rhodopsin kinase (RK), is the primary event in the initiation of desensitization in the visual system. RK binds to the cytoplasmic face of rhodopsin, and the binding results in activation of the enzyme which then phosphorylates rhodopsin at several serine and threonine residues near the carboxyl terminus. To map the RK binding sites, we prepared two sets of rhodopsin mutants in the cytoplasmic CD and EF loops. In the first set, peptide sequences in both loops were either deleted or replaced by indifferent sequences. In the second set of mutants, the charged amino acids (E134, R135, R147, E239, K245, E247, K248, and E249) were replaced by neutral amino acids in groups of 1-3 per mutant. The deletion and replacement mutants in the CD loop showed essentially no phosphorylation, and they appeared to be defective in binding of RK. Of the mutants in the EF loop, that with a deletion of 13 amino acids, was also defective in binding to RK while the second mutant containing a replacement sequence bound RK but showed a reduction of about 70% in Vmax for phosphorylation. The mutants containing charged to neutral amino acid replacements in the CD and EF loops were all phosphorylated but to different levels. The charge reversal mutant E134R/R135E showed a 50% reduction in Vmax relative to wild-type rhodopsin. Replacements of charged residues in the EF loop decreased the Km by 5-fold for E239Q and E247Q/K248L/E239Q. In summary, both the CD and EF cytoplasmic loops are intimately involved in binding and interaction of RK with light-activated rhodopsin.",1997,20,39,1,6,3,8,6,0,2,2,0,2,1

THE COURSE OF THE REACTION WHEN BOTH SUBSTRATE AND ENZYME CONCENTRATIONS ARE DECREASING.,The rate of hydrolysis of edestin by trypsin at 40 degrees and in the presence of 1 M NaCl has been studied. Under these conditions the enzyme is rapidly inactivated and the equation for the reaction may be written See PDF for Equation in which E(t) is the concentration of enzyme during the interval (T(1)-T(2)). This equation has been tested by determining the enzyme concentration at various times during the reaction and substituting these values in the above equation. The experimental results agree with this formula when the initial enzyme or edestin concentrations are varied. No anomalous results of varying substrate concentrations are apparent. It can further be assumed as a first approximation that the enzyme is decomposing monomolecularly and the equation can then be written See PDF for Equation This equation is also satisfactory provided high enzyme concentrations and low edestin concentrations are used. With high concentrations of edestin and low trypsin the effects of the products of the reaction on the enzyme become too large to be neglected and the formula no longer holds.,1924,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ddf40dbba9272717bbbcbd7d76a3ee7968f4be40,An NO derivative of ursodeoxycholic acid protects against Fas-mediated liver injury by inhibiting caspase activity,"Caspases are key mediators in liver inflammation and apoptosis. In the present study we provide evidence that a nitric oxide (NO) derivative of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), NCX-1000 ([2-(acetyloxy)benzoic acid 3-(nitrooxymethyl)phenyl ester]), protects against liver damage in murine models of autoimmune hepatitis induced by i.v. injection of Con A or a Fas agonistic antibody, Jo2. Con A administration causes CD4+ T lymphocytes to accumulate in the liver and up-regulates FasL expression, resulting in FasL-mediated cytotoxicity. Cotreating mice with NCX-1000, but not with UDCA, protected against liver damage induced by Con A and Jo2, inhibited IL-1β, IL-18, and IFN-γ release and caspase 3, 8, and 9 activation. Studies on HepG2 cells demonstrated that NCX-1000, but not UDCA, directly prevented multiple caspase activation induced by Jo2. Incubating HepG2 cells with NCX-1000 resulted in intracellular NO formation and a DTT-reversible inhibition of proapoptotic caspases, suggesting that cysteine S-nitrosylation was the main mechanism responsible for caspase inhibition. Collectively, these data suggest that NCX-1000 protects against T helper 1-mediated liver injury by inhibiting both the proapoptotic and the proinflammatory branches of the caspase superfamily.",2001,38,91,0,4,10,12,7,9,7,9,2,4,3

3518a06279a4b1849ad4701b48ed57479df83a39,6‐31G* basis set for third‐row atoms,"Medium basis sets based upon contractions of Gaussian primitives are developed for the third‐row elements Ga through Kr. The basis functions generalize the 6‐31G and 6‐31G* sets commonly used for atoms up to Ar. A reexamination of the 6‐31G* basis set for K and Ca developed earlier leads to the inclusion of 3d orbitals into the valence space for these atoms. Now the 6‐31G basis for the whole third‐row K through Kr has six primitive Gaussians for 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals, and a split‐valence pair of three and one primitives for valence orbitals, which are 4s, 4p, and 3d. The nature of the polarization functions for third‐row atoms is reexamined as well. The polarization functions for K, Ca, and Ga through Kr are single set of Cartesian d‐type primitives. The polarization functions for transition metals are defined to be a single 7f set of uncontracted primitives.

Temperature-dependent I-V measurements are performed on diodes fabricated from three samples with different compositions of the top (Al,Ga)(As,Sb) barrier. Consistent with picture of thermionic hole transport in the valence band, we find that compared to a sample with binary AlSb barriers, the addition of Ga to the barrier leads to an increase in the current flowing across the barrier, while the addition of As causes a decrease in the current across the barrier. From temperature-dependent Hall measurements performed on the samples we extract the pinning position of the Fermi-level at the surface of the diodes and are therefore able to obtain a zero-bias energy band diagram for the diodes.

c95b0baf88fe3b29fbff84ea3b81b595bdf9262f,THE VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM: PROBLEMS FOR TODAY AND PERSPECTIVES FOR TOMORROW *,"After many years of relative neglect, the vascular endothelium is becoming an object of sustained and rapidly growing interest in biomedical research, as clearly shown by this volume. The current surge of interest is undoubtedly connected with the growing importance of cardiovascular diseases in human medicine. But beyond medical considerations and notwithstanding their urgency, we should realize that interest in this highly specialized tissue is also justified in terms of basic biological science. The vascular endothelium is the main constituent of the wall of the exchange vessels in the microvasculature. It represents a unique and extreme case of epithelial cell differentiation, that makes possible massive exchanges, involving a broad spectrum of molecules (small and large, hydrophilic and hydrophobic), between the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid. Cell differentiation can be regarded as a successful attempt to enhance or perfect a function common to most, if not all, cells of a given multicellular organism. It operates within the limits imposed by a common genome that is expressed, as a minimal requirement, in a common set of essential cell organs. And it often results in overrepresentation (or increased number of copies) of the cell organ for the enhanced function, in comparison to cells differentiated along other lines. The structural and biochemical basis of the unique functional differentiation of the vascular endothelium is in itself a valid and important (definitely not trivial) area of investigation. In terms of basic functions, the exchange vessels of the microvasculature are the most important part of a system, i.e., the circulatory system, that has had a crucial role in the evolution of higher organisms. Without an effective circulatory system, which means without effective exchanges across the vascular endothelium of the microvasculature, the emergence of such organisms, with their huge, extremely crowded, but exquisitely integrated cell populations and their highly refined homeostatic mechanisms, would have been impossible. It could be pointed out that, in higher vertebrates and definitely in man, the capacity of the circulatory system is used practically to its limits, with a minimal margin of safety. Arrest of blood flow, which in turn means arrest of functionally significant exchanges, leads to cell death and organism death in a matter of minutes. Current biomedical interest in the vascular endothelium reflects our strict dependence, with a slim margin of safety, on sustained blood-interstitial fluid exchanges.",1982,34,9,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,2,0

ITIC-Th has higher electron mobility (6.1 × 10(-4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) than ITIC (2.6 × 10(-4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) due to enhanced intermolecular interaction induced by sulfur-sulfur interaction. We fabricate OSCs by blending ITIC-Th acceptor with two different low-band-gap and wide-band-gap polymer donors.

3d797737774ad08da1c526edc1c1676136ee1ab5,Mechanisms of Antineoplastic Action of Somatostatin Analogs,"Abstract Over the past decade, impressive antineoplastic activity of somatostatin analogs has been demonstrated in many tumor models. More recent research has provided information regarding mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing actions of these compounds. These include both ‘direct’ mechanisms that are sequellae of binding of somatostatin analogs to somatostatin receptors present on neoplastic cells and ‘indirect’ mechanisms related to effects of somatostatin analogs on the host. The upregulation of intracellular tyrosine phosphatase activity triggered by binding of ligands to the type II somatostatin receptor has received considerable attention as a direct mechanism, not only because this activity is the converse of the tyrosine kinase activity associated with many peptide mitogen receptors, but also because the type II somatostatin receptor is frequently expressed by common human neoplasms, including breast cancer. The potential importance of indirect mechanisms of action of somatostatin analogs, such as alterations in host insulin-like growth factor physiology, is emphasized by the in vivo antineoplastic activity of these compounds against somatostatin receptor-negative neoplasms. Clinical efficacy and a favorable toxicity profile of somatostatin analogs in the treatment of relatively uncommon conditions such as acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors have already been demonstrated. Preclinical data now are sufficient to justify controlled clinical trials in breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. The development of monthly depot formulations will facilitate the clinical evaluation of somatostatin analogs for these and other indications.",1998,95,180,2,6,14,16,18,16,10,15,8,8,7

In addition to their prominent function in the heart, beta-AR are located on vascular smooth muscle cells, where they mediate vasodilating effects of endogenous catecholamines. In this study, we have investigated in an isometric myograph different types of blood vessels from mice lacking beta(1)- and/or beta(2)-adrenergic receptor subtypes (beta(1)-KO, beta(2)-KO, beta(1)beta(2)-KO). In wild-type mice, isoproterenol induced relaxation of segments from thoracic aorta, carotid, femoral and pulmonary arteries, and portal vein. The relaxant effect of beta-receptor stimulation was absent in femoral and pulmonary arteries from beta(1)-KO mice. In aortic and carotid arteries and in portal veins, the vasodilating effect of isoproterenol was reduced in mice lacking beta(1)- or beta(2)-receptors. However, in these vessels the vasodilating effect was only abolished in double KO mice lacking both beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptors. Vessel relaxation induced by forskolin did not differ between wild-type and KO mice. Similar contributions of beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptors to isoproterenol-induced vasorelaxation were found when vessels from KO mice were compared with wild-type arteries in the presence of subtype-selective beta-receptor antagonists. These studies demonstrate that beta(1)-adrenergic receptors play a dominant role in the murine vascular system to mediate vasodilation. Surprisingly, beta(2)-receptors contribute to adrenergic vasodilation only in a few major blood vessels, suggesting that differential distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes may play an important role in redirection of tissue perfusion.",2001,43,96,1,0,4,2,5,4,10,4,6,2,4

A semiempirical nonionic valence‐bond theory with different degrees of carbon sigma‐orbital following is used to estimate the proton and C13 splitting constants as a function of the nuclear positions that correspond to the out‐of‐plane bending mode. It is found that a considerable ``lag'' in the orbital motion with respect to that of the nuclei is required to achieve a consistent interpretation of the hyperfine spectrum in the methyl radical and its isotopic analogs. A variety of additional factors (i.e., integral parameter variation, breakdown of Born—Oppenheimer approximation, ionic contributions, other vibrations) are also investigated to determine their effects on the hyperfine splittings.

A membranous composite biopolymer adsorbent containing two kind of biopolymers, alginic acid (AA) and humic acid (HA), was prepared. HA, which has high solubility in water, was almost completely immobilized in the adsorbent by a combination of calcium alginate gel and activated carbon powder. A general model for complexation between divalent metal ions and acidic sites on biopolymers was applied to explain the adsorption mechanism of lead on the adsorbent (HA-M). The results showed that the complexation constants and the complexation capacities of lead-AA and lead-HA systems were scarcely influenced by immobilization.",1996,0,33,1,0,0,1,3,0,1,4,1,2,3

Here we report that mature Kb class I MHC molecules bind peptides upon dissociation and reassociation of their light chain.

The thioridazine dosage was then considerably reduced, leading to reappearance of schizophrenic symptoms. The tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, α-methyltyrosine (2 g daily) was then given as additional treatment, and the thioridazine dosage necessary to reattain the pre-trial level of symptomatology was titrated. This dosage, as well as the simultaneous thioridazine plasma levels, were found to be considerably reduced by α-methyltyrosine. The efficacy of this agent as an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase was ascertained by demonstrating a marked reduction in cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid. The observations confirm our earlier data and lend additional support for the hypothesis that central catecholamine neurotransmission is involved in the antipsychotic action of neuroleptic agents.",2005,13,13,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0

As the centre-of-mass energy is increased, regions of smaller $x$ in the parton densities are explored and these are regions of high parton density. As a result, the probability for more than one hard partonic scattering occurring in a single $\gamma \gamma$ or $\gamma p$ collision can become significant. This effect has been simulated using an eikonal prescription combined with the HERWIG Monte Carlo program. The possible effects of multiple hard interactions on event shapes and jet cross sections have been studied in this framework at a range of energies relevant to HERA and LEPII. The results indicate that the effects could be significant.",1995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The problem is solved via the finite element method (FEM). Autofrettage, based on von Mises yield criterion, is simulated by thermal loading and SIFs are determined by the nodal displacement method. SIFs are evaluated for a variety of relative crack depths, a 0 /t =0.01-0.40, and crack ellipticities, a 0 /c =0.5-1.5, emanating from the tip of erosions of different geometry, namely: (a) semi-circular erosions of relative depths of 1-10 percent of the cylinder's wall thickness, t; (b) arc erosions for several dimensionless radii of curvature, r'/t=0.05-0.4; and (c) semi-elliptical erosions with ellipticities of d/h =0.3-2.0. The erosion separation angle, α, is taken from 7 to 360 deg. Deep cracks are found to be almost unaffected by the erosion. The effective SIF for relatively short cracks is enhanced by the presence, separation distance and geometry of the erosion, as well as the crack geometry, and may result in a significant decrease in the vessel's fatigue life of up to an order of magnitude.",2002,15,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Almost none of these cells can be dislodged from the normal liver by forcible perfusion; but after they have taken up finely particulate matter (India ink, iron oxide), they come away in great numbers. When they have phagocyted ferromagnetic iron oxide they can be selected with a magnet from amongst the blood elements present in suspension with them; and they are obtainable in quantity by this means. They do poorly when plated in a thin plasma clot, failing to multiply or to assume their characteristic shape; but they flourish when allowed to attach themselves to strands of lens paper bathed in serum that is frequently changed. Bacterial infection of serum cultures of Kupffer cells from normal rabbits and dogs occurs only as the result of secondary contamination of the materials, whereas it regularly develops in cultures from animals with fever induced by the injection of nucleic acid or of killed B. prodigiosus. Kupffer cells obtained under such conditions are abnormally active, and some can be washed out of the liver of sick animals in the absence of any preliminary phagocytosis of particulate matter. The facts have a bearing both on the conditions conducing to blood invasion and on the response of the Kupffer cells in the emergency. The characters of the isolated Kupffer cells and the results of tests of their presumptive functions will be described in later papers.",1934,3,53,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

To determine whether similar processing events underlie βAPP metabolism in neurons, media were examined following conditioning by primary neuronal cultures derived from embryonic day 17 rats. Immunoprecipitates of conditioned media derived from [35S]methionine pulse‐labeled primary neuronal cultures contained 4‐ and 3‐kDa Aβ‐related species. Radiosequencing analysis revealed that the 4‐kDa band corresponded to conventional Aβ beginning at position Aβ(Asp1), whereas both radio‐sequencing and immunoprecipitation‐mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the 3‐kDa species in these conditioned media began with Aβ(Glu11) at the N terminus, rather than Aβ(Leu17) as does the conventional p3 peptide. Either activation of protein kinase C or inhibition of protein phosphatase 1/2A increased soluble βAPPα release and decreased generation of both the 4‐kDa Aβ and the 3‐kDa N‐truncated Aβ. Unlike results obtained with continuously cultured cells, protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors were more potent at reducing Aβ secretion by neurons than were protein kinase C activators. These data indicate that rodent neurons generate abundant Aβ variant peptides and emphasize the role of protein phosphatases in modulating neuronal Aβ generation.",1998,80,121,0,1,6,17,9,14,10,4,7,5,7

f962713b266c3b20e5e9d503a21cd7ca07dcedf2,Multiple endocytic pathways of G protein-coupled receptors delineated by GIT1 sensitivity.,"Recently, we identified a GTPase-activating protein for the ADP ribosylation factor family of small GTP-binding proteins that we call GIT1. This protein initially was identified as an interacting partner for the G protein-coupled receptor kinases, and its overexpression was found to affect signaling and internalization of the prototypical beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. Here, we report that GIT1 overexpression regulates internalization of numerous, but not all, G protein-coupled receptors. The specificity of the GIT1 effect is not related to the type of G protein to which a receptor couples, but rather to the endocytic route it uses. GIT1 only affects the function of G protein-coupled receptors that are internalized through the clathrin-coated pit pathway in a beta-arrestin- and dynamin-sensitive manner. Furthermore, the GIT1 effect is not limited to G protein-coupled receptors because overexpression of this protein also affects internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor. However, constitutive agonist-independent internalization is not regulated by GIT1, because transferrin uptake is not affected by GIT1 overexpression. Thus, GIT1 is a protein involved in regulating the function of signaling receptors internalized through the clathrin pathway and can be used as a diagnostic tool for defining the endocytic pathway of a receptor.",2000,56,173,13,8,16,10,13,14,15,9,8,8,11

These states involve coherent field superpositions stored in two spatially-separated high-Q cavities. The inequality is expressed in terms of the measured Wigner function of the entangled two-field-mode system at four points in phase space, as proposed in [Banaszek and Wódkiewicz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 2009 (1999)]. We examine the production of these entangled NLMS and the measurement of their Wigner function. The experiment involves circular Rydberg atoms and superconducting millimeter-wave cavities. We present a detailed numerical study of the optimal inequality violation and of the effect of decoherence. We discuss the range of experimental parameters making it possible to observe a locality violation and show that they correspond to realistic, albeit demanding, conditions.

This interaction, however, is not well understood at either the behavioral or neural level. We developed a procedure for mice in which a cognitive measure, sustained attention, is modulated by a motivationally relevant signal that predicts reward probability on a trial-by-trial basis. Using this paradigm, we tested the interaction between motivation and cognition in mice that model the increased striatal D2 receptor activity observed in schizophrenia patients (D2R-OE mice). In control mice, attention was modulated by signaled-reward probability. In D2R-OE mice, however, attention was not modulated by reward-related cues. This impairment was not due to any global deficits in attention or maintenance of the trial-specific information in working memory. Turning off the transgene in D2R-OE mice rescued the motivational modulation of attention. These results indicate that deficits in motivation impair the ability to use reward-related cues to recruit attention and that improving motivation improves functional cognitive performance. These results further suggest that addressing motivational impairments in patients is critical to achieving substantive cognitive and functional gains.",2015,50,21,0,2,2,5,5,3,2,2,0,0,0

With so little progress made toward finding a cure—or, better, a prevention—it is time to rethink the path to progress. This requires a change in perspective on the type of research that will make a difference. The lesson learned from cancer research is that a new commitment means rethinking the fundamental approach to the disease. Cancer research moved from taking potshots with, usually, cytotoxic drugs to a bottom-up, mechanism-based approach in which newly acquired genetic knowledge played the largest role. Today, that effort has produced a platform of knowledge from which academia and industry are drawing. For neurodegenerative disease, the genetic approach remains valid but the problem must concurrently be approached from a complementary, robust cell biological perspective, focusing on the cellular cascade of events that lead to neuronal cell death.",2016,18,8,0,1,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0

The deduced amino acid sequence of Syrian hamster PrPC identifies two potential sites for the addition of Asn-linked carbohydrates at amino acids 181-183 (Asn-Ile-Thr) and 197-199 (Asn-Phe-Thr). We have altered these sites by replacing the threonine residues with alanine and expressed the mutant proteins transiently in CV1 cells utilizing a mutagenesis vector with the T7 promoter located upstream from the PrP gene. The T7 RNA polymerase was supplied by infection with a recombinant vaccinia virus. The 3 mutant proteins (PrPAla183, PrPAla199 and PrPAla183/199) have a reduced relative molecular weight compared to wild-type (wt) PrP. Deglycosylation as well as synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin reduced the relative molecular weight of all the PrP species to that of the double mutant PrPAla183/199. Our results indicate that both single-site mutant prion proteins are glycosylated at non-mutated sites and they suggest that both potential sites for Asn-linked glycosylation are utilized in wt PrPC. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that while wt PrPC localizes to the cell surface, all the mutant PrP molecules accumulate intracellularly. The site of accumulation of PrPAla183 is probably prior to the mid-Golgi stack since this protein does not acquire resistance to endoglycosidase H. Whether the intracellular locations of the mutant PrPC species are the same as those identified for the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) remains to be established.",1990,0,78,0,0,5,3,1,3,1,1,5,4,4

When a protein is tagged by fusion to a fluorescent protein, interactions between fluorescent proteins can undesirably disturb targeting or function. Unfortunately, all wild-type yellow-to-red fluorescent proteins reported so far are obligately tetrameric and often toxic or disruptive. The first true monomer was mRFP1, derived from the Discosoma sp. fluorescent protein “DsRed” by directed evolution first to increase the speed of maturation, then to break each subunit interface while restoring fluorescence, which cumulatively required 33 substitutions. Although mRFP1 has already proven widely useful, several properties could bear improvement and more colors would be welcome. We report the next generation of monomers. The latest red version matures more completely, is more tolerant of N-terminal fusions and is over tenfold more photostable than mRFP1. Three monomers with distinguishable hues from yellow-orange to red-orange have higher quantum efficiencies.",2004,34,4326,270,3,56,145,202,318,357,332,311,345,322
8fa503cfc252aaabea6bea00ea06e828846b8a1f,Wiggly whipped inflation,"Motivated by BICEP2 results on the CMB polarization B-mode which imply primordial gravitational waves are produced when the Universe has the expansion rate of about H ≈ 10{sup 14} GeV, and by deviations from a smooth power-law behavior for multipoles l <50 in the CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum found in the WMAP and Planck experiments, we have expanded our class of large field inflationary models that fit both the BICEP2 and Planck CMB observations consistently. These best-fitted large field models are found to have a transition from a faster roll to the slow roll V(φ)=m{sup 2} φ{sup 2}/2 inflation at a field value around 14.6 M{sub Pl} and thus a potential energy of V(φ) ∼ (10{sup 16} GeV){sup 4}. In general this transition with sharp features in the inflaton potential produces not only suppression of scalars relative to tensor modes at small k but also introduces wiggles in the primordial perturbation spectrum. These wiggles are shown to be useful to explain some localized features in the CMB angular power spectrum and can also have other observational consequences. Thus, primordial GW can be used now to make a tomography of inflation determining its fine structure. The resulting Wiggly Whipped Inflation scenario is described in details and the anticipatedmore » perturbation power spectra, CMB power spectra, non-Gaussianity and other observational consequences are calculated and compared to existing and forthcoming observations.« less",2014,160,59,0,7,11,6,9,4,6,9,6,1,0

The emission intensity exhibited a clear threshold behavior with respect to the pump power. Optical anisotropy was also observed between the two perpendicular in-plane directions [1123] and [1010] for semipolar LD structures, with significantly lower pump thresholds for emission along [1123]. The SE wavelength, measured just above threshold, was blue-shifted with respect to the spontaneous emission wavelength measured just below threshold. These initial results indicate that semipolar (1122) GaN is a promising orientation for the realization of blue-green and green LDs.",2008,18,71,0,0,16,19,10,9,4,3,1,5,1

The effect of powder feeding rate on the yield and the specific surface area of UFPs was investigated by varying the powder feeding rate in two orders of magnitude (0.07-7.19g/min). The composition and flow rate of plasma gas, the power of plasma and the internal pressure of apparatus were kept constant during the experiments. Furthermore, the applicable range of Brownian coagulation mechanism was discussed. The UFPs were isolated and spherical in shape when the powder feeding rate was low; while they were collided and coalesced particles when the powder feeding rate was high. The specific surface area of UFPs was the highest at a low feeding rate, although it was not dependent on the collection sites when the powder feeding rate was higher than 0.2g/min. The present experiments suggested that the particle formation is controlled by Brownian coagulation in a narrow range of powder feeding rate at a relatively low value.",2004,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
